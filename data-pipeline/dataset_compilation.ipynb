The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula:\\n\\n    $$A = 4 \\\\pi R^2$$\\n\\n    where:\\n    *   \\\\(A\\\\) is the surface area of the sphere.\\n    *   \\\\(R\\\\) is the radius of the sphere (in this case, the radius of the Sun).\\n    *   \\\\(\\\\pi\\\\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\\n\\n*   **Total Radiant Energy (Power) of the Sun:** To find the total radiant energy emitted by the Sun (which is the power output), we need to multiply the radiant heat power per unit area (\\\\(j^*\\\\)) by the total surface area of the Sun (\\\\(A\\\\)).  Therefore, the total power \\\\(E\\\\) emitted by the Sun is:\\n\\n    $$E = j^* \\\\cdot A = (\\\\sigma T^4) \\\\cdot (4 \\\\pi R^2) = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi R^2 \\\\cdot T^4$$\\n\\n    In the problem, this initial energy is denoted as \\\\(E_1\\\\). So we have:\\n\\n    $$E_1 = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi R^2 \\\\cdot T^4$$\\n\\n    This equation represents the total radiant power emitted by the Sun in the initial conditions, before any changes in temperature or radius.  It tells us that the energy radiated is proportional to the surface area of the Sun and to the fourth power of its temperature.\\n\\n**Step 2: Write down the New Energy Expression**\\n\\nThe new energy expression when the temperature is doubled to \\\\(2T\\\\) and the radius is doubled to \\\\(2R\\\\) is given as:\\n$$E_2 = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi (2R)^2 \\\\cdot (2T)^4$$\\n\\nLet's understand how this new expression is formed:\\n\\n*   **New Radius:** The problem states that the radius of the Sun is increased from \\\\(R\\\\) to \\\\(2R\\\\).

The new surface area becomes \\\\(4 \\\\pi (2R)^2\\\\).\\n\\n*   **New Temperature:** The problem states that the temperature of the Sun is increased from \\\\(T\\\\) to \\\\(2T\\\\).

We can cancel them out:\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{(2R)^2 \\\\cdot (2T)^4}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}$$\\n\\n2.  **Expand the terms with exponents:** Apply the exponent rules \\\\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\\\) and \\\\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\\\cdot n}\\\\):\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{(2^2 R^2) \\\\cdot (2^4 T^4)}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4} = \\\\frac{2^2 \\\\cdot R^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot T^4}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}$$\\n\\n3.  **Rearrange terms and cancel out \\\\(R^2\\\\) and \\\\(T^4\\\\):** We can rearrange the terms to group the powers of 2 together and separate the variables \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(T\\\\):\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4} = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R^2}{R^2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{T^4}{T^4}$$\\n\\n    Now, we can cancel out \\\\(R^2\\\\) from the numerator and denominator, and similarly cancel out \\\\(T^4\\\\):\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4$$\\n\\n4.  **Simplify using exponent rule \\\\(a^m \\\\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\\\):**  To multiply powers with the same base, we add the exponents:\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = 2^{2+4} = 2^6$$\\n\\n5.  **Calculate \\\\(2^6\\\\):**\\n\\n    $$2^6 = 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 = 4 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 4 = 16 \\\\times 4 = 64$$\\n\\nTherefore, the ratio of the radiant energy received on Earth to what it was previously is 64.\\n\\n**Physical Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe radiant energy emitted by the Sun is increased by a factor of 64. This significant increase is due to the combined effect of doubling both the radius and the temperature. Doubling the radius quadruples the surface area (\\\\(2^2 = 4\\\\)), and doubling the temperature increases the energy radiated per unit area by a factor of \\\\(2^4 = 16\\\\). The combined effect is a multiplication of these factors (\\\\(4 \\\\times 16 = 64\\\\)), leading to a 64-fold increase in the total radiant energy emitted by the Sun.\\n\\nSo the correct answer is **(D) 64**.\", 'alternative_solutions': ['One could also consider the ratio of the powers emitted by the sun before and after the change and relate that to the energy received on Earth, recognizing that the distance between the Sun and Earth remains constant.'], 'problem_difficulty': 5, 'final_answers_in_brief': ['The ratio of the new radiant energy to the previous radiant energy is 64.'], 'steps': 3, 'source': 'A Complete Resource Book for JEE Main 2018: Physics - by Sanjeev Kumar'}\n"

In the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we replace \\\\(T\\\\) with \\\\(2T\\\\).  The new radiant heat power per unit area becomes \\\\(\\\\sigma (2T)^4\\\\).\\n\\n*   **New Total Radiant Energy (Power):**  Similar to step 1, the new total radiant energy \\\\(E_2\\\\) is the product of the new radiant heat power per unit area and the new surface area:\\n\\n    $$E_2 = [\\\\sigma (2T)^4] \\\\cdot [4 \\\\pi (2R)^2] = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi (2R)^2 \\\\cdot (2T)^4$$\\n\\n    This equation represents the total radiant power emitted by the Sun after its temperature and radius have been doubled.\\n\\nLet's further expand the terms in the equation for \\\\(E_2\\\\) to make the ratio calculation in the next step clearer:\\n\\n$$E_2 = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi (2R)^2 \\\\cdot (2T)^4 = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi (2^2 R^2) \\\\cdot (2^4 T^4) = \\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi (4 R^2) \\\\cdot (16 T^4)$$\\n\\n**Step 3: Compute the Ratio**\\n\\nTo find the ratio of the radiant energy received on Earth in the new scenario to the initial scenario, we need to calculate the ratio \\\\(E_2 / E_1\\\\).\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi (2R)^2 \\\\cdot (2T)^4}{\\\\sigma \\\\cdot 4 \\\\pi R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}$$\\n\\nNow, let's simplify this expression step-by-step:\\n\\n1.  **Cancel out common terms:** We can see that \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) and \\\\(4 \\\\pi\\\\) are present in both the numerator and the denominator.  We can cancel them out:\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{(2R)^2 \\\\cdot (2T)^4}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}$$\\n\\n2.  **Expand the terms with exponents:** Apply the exponent rules \\\\((ab)^n = a^n b^n\\\\) and \\\\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\\\cdot n}\\\\):\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{(2^2 R^2) \\\\cdot (2^4 T^4)}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4} = \\\\frac{2^2 \\\\cdot R^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot T^4}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}$$\\n\\n3.  **Rearrange terms and cancel out \\\\(R^2\\\\) and \\\\(T^4\\\\):** We can rearrange the terms to group the powers of 2 together and separate the variables \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(T\\\\):\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\\\frac{2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot R^2 \\\\cdot T^4}{R^2 \\\\cdot T^4} = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R^2}{R^2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{T^4}{T^4}$$\\n\\n    Now, we can cancel out \\\\(R^2\\\\) from the numerator and denominator, and similarly cancel out \\\\(T^4\\\\):\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 1 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 2^4$$\\n\\n4.  **Simplify using exponent rule \\\\(a^m \\\\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\\\):**  To multiply powers with the same base, we add the exponents:\\n\\n    $$\\\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = 2^{2+4} = 2^6$$\\n\\n5.  **Calculate \\\\(2^6\\\\):**\\n\\n    $$2^6 = 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 2 = 4 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 4 = 16 \\\\times 4 = 64$$\\n\\nTherefore, the ratio of the radiant energy received on Earth to what it was previously is 64.\\n\\n**Physical Interpretation:**\\n\\nThe radiant energy emitted by the Sun is increased by a factor of 64. This significant increase is due to the combined effect of doubling both the radius and the temperature. Doubling the radius quadruples the surface area (\\\\(2^2 = 4\\\\)), and doubling the temperature increases the energy radiated per unit area by a factor of \\\\(2^4 = 16\\\\). The combined effect is a multiplication of these factors (\\\\(4 \\\\times 16 = 64\\\\)), leading to a 64-fold increase in the total radiant energy emitted by the Sun.\\n\\nSo the correct answer is **(D) 64**.\", 'alternative_solutions': ['One could also consider the ratio of the powers emitted by the sun before and after the change and relate that to the energy received on Earth, recognizing that the distance between the Sun and Earth remains constant.'], 'problem_difficulty': 5, 'final_answers_in_brief': ['The ratio of the new radiant energy to the previous radiant energy is 64.'], 'steps': 3, 'source': 'A Complete Resource Book for JEE Main 2018: Physics - by Sanjeev Kumar'}\n",
